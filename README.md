# gRPC Shared Memory Coordination System (Mini 2)

## üìå Overview

This project is part of CMPE 273's Mini 2 assignment. It demonstrates a distributed system consisting of multiple processes communicating across multiple machines using **gRPC** and **shared memory**, designed in an **overlay tree structure**.

The system features:
- Multi-language gRPC (C++ server, Python/C++ clients)
- Asynchronous communication across a process network
- Shared memory for intra-machine data exchange
- Transactionless caching to improve performance
- A single public portal (Process A) handling all external client queries

---

## üß† Concepts Explored

- Shared Memory (POSIX `shm_open`, `mmap`)
- gRPC Inter-Process and Inter-Machine Communication
- Asynchronous Servers in C++
- Overlay Tree Design & Query Routing
- Caching Mechanisms (in-memory)
- Multi-language system (C++ & Python)

- **Process A**: Public entry point (portal)
- **Processes B‚ÄìE**: Internal data contributors
- Each process has edges (peers) defined in `overlay_map.json`
